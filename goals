- Learn Latin at all costs.

This includes using every gadget I have in Latin as well.  Learning
the basics of the language, watching some videos reading old books
that teach it etc. By all means I will learn Latin.

> UPDATE: I am halfway through LLPSI. Good book but I am too much
of a normie I guess.

- Get work done.

Same as last year. Although I will adhere to UNIX philosophy more
from now on. I find there to be something profound and mystically
useful about it. Just simplifying everything is dumb yes, but it
does have places and where it strikes a good chord - something
simple will always be preferrable.

- Sleep is important!

I should fix my sleep schedule. I break it regularly and that is
mostly my inability to hold myself accountable and actually take
action.  Or that I just can't sleep without listening bullshit on
youtube.  Whichever you wish to entertain will do.

> UPDATE: I have since started taking melatonin, it works wonders!

- Calisthenics is actually dope.

I should work on my body. This type of job just doesn't keep it
healthy as a side effect. In fact I heard really horrifying stories
from my colleagues about broken backs and achy wrists.  Times are
hard indeed!

I am not the type of guy to go to a social place like a gym and
sweat the fuck out of my system! No, I'll do it at home and won't
buy much of or any equipment if possible. So then, calisthenics
it is!
