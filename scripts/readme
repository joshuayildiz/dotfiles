Hi, this directory contains scripts I use regularly. Most of them are
solely acme helpers.

| Script  | Purpose                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Clear   | clears whole acme window       |
| align   | aligns columns on a character  |
| c+/c-   | comment/decomment              |
| i+/i-   | indent/dedent                  |
| tblfmt  | format markdown table          |

Some of them are written in C. Just run mk and they should build.
