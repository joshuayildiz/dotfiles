Object Class: Euclid

## Special Containment Procedures:

All software projects exceeding 300 lines of code or possessing a
semantic complexity rate of 60 or higher are to be subjected to
regular review and updates. The current global state and any recent
events relevant to SEP-002 must be reflected within the affected
software corpus as necessary.

To effectively summarize, deliberate, and keep these projects
up-to-date, Large Language Models (LLMs) can be employed, provided
they are used with human oversight. Automation of this process is
strictly prohibited, as unsupervised LLMs have been known to
inadvertently cause significant deviations from a project's original
scope, potentially leading to a CK-Class Reality Restructuring
Scenario.

Projects exhibiting degradation levels of 20 or higher are to be
prioritized for immediate updates to avert an XK-Class End-of-the-World
Scenario. Projects with degradation levels exceeding 40 must be
rewritten, decommissioned, or otherwise terminated without delay.

Additionally, all systems should be monitored for unexpected
cat-themed behaviors, such as the appearance of fictional feline
employees or humorous cat-related messages. These manifestations
are indicative of SEP-002's influence and should be addressed
promptly to prevent further degradation.

## Description:

SEP-002 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting software projects that
exceed 300 lines of code or possess a semantic complexity rate of
60 or higher, causing them to degrade over time without any direct
alterations to the code or its execution environment. This degradation
extends beyond individual files, often impacting entire codebases.

The phenomenon was first observed in [REDACTED], when a series of
software projects across multiple organizations began exhibiting
unexplained degradation despite no changes in their code or runtime
environments. Notably, many affected projects developed unexpected
cat-themed elements, such as fictional employees or humorous
signatures. Initial investigations linked these occurrences to
SEP-002, prompting further research and the establishment of
containment procedures.

Mitigation of SEP-002 is achievable through regular updates to the
codebase. Research indicates that even minor changes, such as
updating the `README.md`, can be effective in counteracting the
anomaly. More robust strategies include:

- Implementing automated testing to identify bugs resulting from
degradation.  - Regularly addressing user stories to mitigate
degradation from scope creep.  - Employing LLM-based and traditional
code quality assessment tools.

## Addendum SEP-002-A:

### Incident Log SEP-002-01

On [REDACTED], a software development team at [REDACTED] Corporation
reported an unusual incident involving their project management
software, "Soyjira" Despite no recent updates or changes, the
software began assigning all tasks to a fictional employee named
"Mr. Fluffles," who was listed as a "Senior Feline Developer."

Attempts to remove Mr. Fluffles from the system were unsuccessful,
as the software insisted that Mr. Fluffles was "indispensable to
the project." Further investigation revealed that the anomaly was
a manifestation of SEP-002, which had altered the codebase to include
Mr. Fluffles as a permanent team member.

The incident was resolved by updating the software's codebase and
implementing regular code reviews, which successfully removed Mr.
Fluffles from the system. However, the team has since adopted a
plush cat toy as their unofficial mascot, humorously named "Mr.
Fluffles," to commemorate the event.

### Incident Log SEP-002-02

On [REDACTED], the IT department at [REDACTED] University experienced
an unusual event with their campus-wide email system, "QuantumMail
X." Without any prior warning, the system began appending the phrase
"Have a purr-fect day!" to the end of every email sent through the
platform.

Attempts to correct this behavior were initially unsuccessful, as
the system's codebase had been altered to include this phrase as a
default signature. Further analysis identified the cause as SEP-002,
which had anomalously modified the system's settings.

The anomaly was resolved by rewriting the entire email system in
Rust, a language known for its memory safety and concurrency features.
This rewrite not only removed the anomalous behavior but also
improved the system's performance and reliability. Despite the
resolution, the phrase became a beloved inside joke among the
university staff, who occasionally use it in their communications
for a bit of levity.

### Incident Log SEP-002-03

On [REDACTED], a financial software suite used by [REDACTED] Bank
began experiencing unusual behavior. The software, known as "FinTrack
Pro," started generating monthly financial reports with a section
titled "Feline Financial Forecasts." This section included nonsensical
predictions about the stock market based on the "mood of the office
cat."

Attempts to remove this section from the reports were initially
unsuccessful, as the codebase had been altered to include it as a
mandatory feature. Further investigation revealed that SEP-002 was
responsible for the anomaly, having introduced the cat-themed content
into the financial algorithms.

The issue was resolved by migrating the software from the cloud to
a secure on-premises server, effectively isolating it from SEP-002's
influence. This transition not only removed the anomalous behavior
but also enhanced the security and control over the software. The
bank's staff, amused by the incident, decided to create a lighthearted
newsletter featuring "Feline Financial Forecasts" as a humorous nod
to the anomaly.

## Addendum SEP-002-B: Interview Log

### Interview Log SEP-002-03-A

**Interviewed:** [REDACTED], Software Engineer at [REDACTED] Bank

**Interviewer:** Dr. [REDACTED], SEP Research Team

**Date:** [REDACTED]

**Begin Log**

**Dr. [REDACTED]:** Thank you for joining us today. Can you describe
how you first noticed the anomaly in "FinTrack Pro"?

**Software Engineer:** Sure thing. You know, I usually just slog
through these reports because, well, it's a paycheck, right? But
this time, something caught my eyeâ€”a new section titled "Feline
Financial Forecasts." At first, I thought it was a prank, but when
I checked the code, it was embedded as a custom DSL that could only
generate Financial Feline Forecasts. Honestly, it was the most
entertaining thing I've seen at work in ages.

**Dr. [REDACTED]:** What was your initial reaction upon discovering
this section?

**Software Engineer:** I was baffled, but also kind of amused. I
mean, the predictions were based on the "mood of the office cat."
It was ridiculous, but in a way, it made my day. I knew something
was off because no one in our team would add such a feature seriously,
but it was a nice break from the usual monotony.

**Dr. [REDACTED]:** How did you proceed after identifying the
anomaly?

**Software Engineer:** I immediately flagged it to my team and
started a code review. We couldn't find any recent changes that
would explain it, but then we stumbled upon a comment block in the
code that read, "CALL THESE GUYS PWEASE," followed by the contact
info for the SEP research team. It was written in a playful cat
tone, which was both bizarre and oddly fitting given the circumstances.

**Dr. [REDACTED]:** How has the team responded to the resolution
of the anomaly?

**Software Engineer:** After migrating the software to an on-premises
server, the issue was resolved. Interestingly, this move also cut
our operational costs in half, which was a pleasant surprise. The
team found the whole situation quite humorous, and we've even started
a lighthearted newsletter with "Feline Financial Forecasts" as a
fun nod to the incident. It's the little things like this that make
the job bearable.

**Dr. [REDACTED]:** Thank you for sharing your experience with us.
Your insights have been invaluable.
