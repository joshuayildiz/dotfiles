Mobile LLM Prototyper

- Use LLMs as much as you can, manual editing only when needed

- Offer completions when a line is selected (akin to cursor), LSP
integration (trivial with remote LSP info, have to parse in app
tho)

- Free until three projects, 5 sec runtime per project in docker
containers and 128mb memory, no disk space, all private projects
with invitation

- GitHub export/import, git integration (how???)

- Unlimited everything after 30$ monthly subscription

- Project templates like replit
