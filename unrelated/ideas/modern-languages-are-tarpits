Due its nature, ideas without fruit are conjured far more than those
with merit.

Simple is hard, precisely because to simplify implies prior chaos.

People today confuse simple with ill-defined. On one spectrum is a
case with well-thought-out, relatively cheap taxing on cognition
with ill-defined yet still cheap taxing ideals. This basic confusion
of the simple-thats-concrete with simple-thats-ideal inevitably
causes misalignment of software with its goals.

Ideal may be clear yet the reality is not pretty.
