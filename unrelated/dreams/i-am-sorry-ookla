I was with friends on a rooftop. Talking and having fun and there
was this girl we all liked. I remember her being kind, caring and
over all a nice person.

I do not know if I have influenced the outcome. Yet I feel this
terrible pain anyway. Suddenly the balcony safeguards behind her
dropped as she sat and leaned her back. I still cant forget how she
fell from almost 4 stories high, trying to hold unto something to
not fall. Maybe I was too paranoid of something ruining the moment,
which itself ruined the dream by influence.

Her body was shattered into pieces when I looked down. And I ran
in fear. Why did I run away? I didnt want to run away. I couldve
done something. Called an ambulance or just asked for help. I instead
chose to ignore.

I couldve taken responsibility. I couldve saved her life. I remember
reaching out to grab her hand when she was about to fall. I couldve
grabbed her hand. I feel terrible

Am I this horrible of a person? What does this dream even mean? I
have so many questions and doubts now. I need to do better and yet
I feel like doing nothing today. I guess I am a terrible person
after all. I should stop crying probably. This was not a nightmare
per se but what else is worse than this? I wish it was just a
nightmare instead of this.

I am sorry Ookla. I should have been better.
