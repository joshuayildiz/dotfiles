Independence
============

I have been always fascinated by what humans could accomplish given
the right environment with right resources and a good enough drive
- virtue as they say.

But lately my little brain has been indulgent in this idea that the
current setup we have is ultimately unsustainable in the long run.
There is just too much specialization and too much co-dependance
between each and every one of us and the system that we have built
- it is almost impossible to do anything without interacting with
something else.

Those include:

- Water/food: need a whole grocery chain for it

- Housing: prices gone terribly high in the past couple years

- Socializing: very much isolated, people do not socialize as
healthly as we used to

- Computing: big factories to produce the chips and equipment,
nothing is repairable

And it got me thinking. What is the root cause of anything here?
_All of it is dependent on an income._ As long as you have money
yes this works, but the moment you run out of it is the issue really
crystalized for you.  Until then is it just conspiracy theories and
"don't worry about it".  I have a solution tho!


Co-dependance is actually hard
==============================

Every software tools or project or product or whatever thing I was
doing have always implied a sense of structure. Somehow and someplan
to put things, order stuff around and define exact relations. What
I have figured was that regardless of what you are doing, keeping
the logic and the data local, without hiding the minutae of details
was the right design to do.

Our current society depends on large, centralized factories for
literally everything. Housing, food, water, electricity, gas and
everything is dependent on centralized resources that we then split
among those who need it.

I have something else different in my mind. What if, everyone,
including the worst of us, was knowledable enough of technology,
that we just provided the necessary tools to everyone, and they
could go and get their necessities by themselves?

Much greater independence and much greater autonomy per citizen?
No dependency whatsoever even to the government! Of course this
also means schools are just a nuisance in this setup. Because they
are centralized institutions, designed for massive amounts of
students to learn communially. But that is easy to fix. We just
abolish the whole school system and instead put in milestones per
subject that everyone can learn at their own pace but I am getting
out of topic here.


Smallest unit is the family
===========================

Seriously, you don't need much.

- People: neighbors and family members, just father/mother and son.

- Housing: people own their land, constructions are solely
prefabricated.  Easy to maintain and repair, lasts a long time.
Doesn't cost much to be built.

- Food: Grows on the land. Big food chains are luxury yes, but they
are the second choice anyways. Neighbors support each other. The
land just gives.

- Water: The current infrastructure for water is brilliant. We just
have to expand it enough to support a wider area.

- Electricity: solar panels are cheaper and provided with discounts
by the government. It is hard to get one yes, but you buy it once
anyway.

- Internet: with some degradation, we keep it strictly for the
public.  Everything is a document, no video, no audio. Just text.
As it should always have been.

- Wage: you work 3 days a week.

All in all this setup reduces the dependence between all of these
and an income. Corporations can no longer `extract` value from
normies but instead have to actually create it, somehow.

What is my plan to actually make this work?

- [ ] Get land.
- [ ] Build a prefabricated small house-like-thing.
- [ ] Get good at farming - not excellent, just good enough.
- [ ] Get some solar panels with power storage.
- [ ] Get an electric car.
- [ ] Get electric heat stuff so I don't freeze in winter.
- [ ] Have a stable from the web, albeit tiny and insignificant. See below:

But do I need much at this point? I can just do whatever I want with it.
I don't have to worry about where I will live, what I'll eat, whom I'll hang
out with. And if the WW3 ever happens I just hide in my basement like usual.

This is too much wishful thinking tho.
Anyways the next goal is just getting a car.
Then a land. Then whatever I want.
