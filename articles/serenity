Serenity Driven Development
===========================

Too often I am amazed by how little I can manage if I am under
stress or I have too much on my mind. I think a large factor in how
our modern computing came together was not the stupid deadlines or
stressful pressuring from the high-ups, but instead a chill environment
provided to enthusiastic people that just wanted build cool and
useful stuff.

Much of the stuff I use is almost 50 years old. I use UNIX, vim,
C, Go.  I don't go much out of my comfort zone for these things.
The first Mac is almost older than my own father, just shy of a
couple years.

And yet I feel like we haven't really learnt much of anything.
People still pressure each other for imaginary deadlines and miss
them like crazy. There is sense of urgency to stay alive when it
is the very right given to every living being by God.  I guess we
just lost touch with it.


Oh yes but where does this discussion go?
=========================================

I recently went to the garden my grandpa does cool stuff.  To be
honest I am not very close to them. In fact I avoid them as much
as possble. There are some "ideological differences" between them
and my father. So my siblings, mother and myself have always been
the ones squeezed between two opposing forces. If you haven't yet
figured it out, I tend to avoid conflict if possible. Even if it
is just within me. I am miserable like that.

So when I went there, I had this thought in my mind to do something
to my room or my dev setup or my daily routine to kinda force some
productiveness out of it. Because frankly speaking I had work to
do that I was procrastinating away from. Anyways the moment I put
my foot on the green grass was just so.. liberating. I felt this
almost serene feeling of being very light. No weight. Nothing to
carry around. I didn't even want to know why I felt that way.  It
was that much freeing and really nice frankly speaking.

Then I thought maybe the internet and my almost-always-bound
connection to the vast world was weighing me down to levels of
utmost misery.  That's why I am leaving everything behind. I'll
still write software.  I am earning a living doing it. But, I'll
just be less dependent on it.  You can check out my words at the
`independence` file on this repository. So from now on, we will
compile everything I need from source.

I'll use software that I can understand by reading it in an afternoon.
Everything else is just too complicated. This will take a lot of
time to get used to. I'll also try to do that with my own projects
at work but we will see. I may have to eventually back out of this
decision.  It isn't practical yes, but it is the best option I have
found.

There is something profound about working in serenity.  Even if I
don't have the comfort, I have peace of mind.


Serenity Driven Development Is
==============================

- You move everything between you and work aside.

- Have the necessary tools to keep you company.

- Do not let stress build up.

There is something truly productive in this setup.  You don't even
need fancy IDEs or state-of-the-art LLMs or powerfully-typed
languages. You need to sit and just be. Work as you may and get
things done. There is really nothing in it. Don't fret about it.
